  Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
  - answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
  - answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
  - answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
  - answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

  Examples:
  Input: n = 5
  Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

  Constraints:
  1 <= n <= 10^4
snippets:
  - "def fizzBuzz(n):"
  - "    res = []"
  - "    for i in range(1, n + 1):"
  - "        if i % 15 == 0:"
  - "            res.append(\"FizzBuzz\")"
  - "        elif i % 3 == 0:"
  - "            res.append(\"Fizz\")"
  - "        elif i % 5 == 0:"
  - "            res.append(\"Buzz\")"
  - "        else:"
  - "            res.append(str(i))"
  - "    return res"
