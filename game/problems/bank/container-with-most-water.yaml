  Given n non-negative integers height, each represents a vertical line at
  index i with height[i]. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a
  container that holds the most water.

  Example 1:
  Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
  Output: 49
  
  Example 2:
  Input: height = [1,1]
  Output: 1

  Example 3:
  Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
  Output: 16

  Constraints:
  • 2 <= height.length <= 10^5
  • 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
snippets:
  - "def maxArea(height: list[int]) -> int:"
  - "    i, j = 0, len(height) - 1"
  - "    best = 0"
  - "    while i < j:"
  - "        h = min(height[i], height[j])"
  - "        best = max(best, h * (j - i))"
  - "        if height[i] < height[j]:"
  - "            i += 1"
  - "        else:"
  - "            j -= 1"
  - "    return best"
