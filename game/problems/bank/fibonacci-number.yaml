  The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n), form a sequence called the Fibonacci
  sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting
  from 0 and 1. Given n, return F(n).

  Example 1:
  Input: n = 2
  Output: 1

  Example 2:
  Input: n = 3
  Output: 2

  Example 3:
  Input: n = 10
  Output: 55

  Constraints:
  â€¢ 0 <= n <= 30
snippets:
  - "def fib(n: int) -> int:"
  - "    if n < 2:"
  - "        return n"
  - "    a, b = 0, 1"
  - "    for _ in range(2, n + 1):"
  - "        a, b = b, a + b"
  - "    return b"
