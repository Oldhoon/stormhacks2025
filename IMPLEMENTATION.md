# Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A compositor-based game controller that manages two independent game modes:
1. **Arena Mode**: 2D fighting game with Samurai vs Knight
2. **LeetCode Mode**: Code puzzle-solving interface with timer

## Key Components

### controller.py
- `GameController` class that manages:
  - Two offscreen pygame surfaces (arena_surface, leetcode_surface)
  - State machine with 3 states: ARENA, LC, ENDED
  - Event routing to appropriate subsystems
  - Surface composition and display

### lc_screen.py
- `LCScreen` class that:
  - Renders LeetCode problem UI to a surface
  - Manages 30-second countdown timer
  - Handles code snippet drag-and-drop
  - Detects problem completion

### arena.py (Modified)
- Updated `Arena.__init__` to accept optional `screen` parameter
- Removed pygame.display.flip() calls when rendering to surface
- Maintains backward compatibility (can still run standalone)

## State Transitions

```
ARENA → (Knight dies) → LC
LC → (Timer expires) → ARENA (Knight revived)
LC → (Problem solved) → ENDED (Victory)
ENDED → (Press R) → ARENA (Restart)
```

## Test Results

✓ All 5 integration tests passing (test_controller.py)
✓ All game flow scenarios passing (test_game_flow.py)
✓ Screenshots generated for all states
✓ Backward compatibility maintained

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `controller.py` - Main game controller
- `lc_screen.py` - LeetCode UI wrapper
- `main.py` - Entry point
- `RUNNING.md` - User documentation
- `test_controller.py` - Integration tests
- `test_game_flow.py` - Game flow simulation tests
- `capture_screenshots.py` - Screenshot generation
- `docs/screenshots/` - Visual documentation

**Modified:**
- `arena.py` - Added surface support, maintained backward compatibility
- `README.md` - Added usage instructions and screenshots

## Design Decisions

1. **Minimal Changes**: Arena.py changes were surgical - only added screen parameter and removed display.flip()
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each subsystem (Arena, LCScreen) owns its surface
3. **State Machine**: Clean state transitions managed by controller
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Arena can still run standalone with `python3 arena.py`
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests verify all transitions work correctly

## How It Works

1. Controller creates one display window and two offscreen surfaces
2. Arena and LCScreen each render to their own surface independently
3. Controller blits the active surface to the display based on current state
4. State transitions triggered by game events (knight death, timer expiry, problem solved)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Surface blending/transitions for smoother state changes
- Multiple LeetCode problems in sequence
- Difficulty scaling based on arena performance
- Health recovery on problem solve
