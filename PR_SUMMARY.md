# Pull Request Summary

## Overview
Implemented a compositor-based game controller that manages two independent game modes (Arena and LeetCode) as separate surfaces with automatic state transitions.

## Requirements Implemented ✅

### 1. Separate Surfaces ✅
- Created `arena_surface` and `leetcode_surface` as offscreen pygame surfaces
- Each subsystem renders independently to its own surface
- Arena game runs on arena_surface
- LeetCode UI runs on leetcode_surface

### 2. Compositor File ✅
- Created `controller.py` with `GameController` class
- Initializes single pygame display window
- Creates both offscreen surfaces
- Manages state machine: "ARENA", "LC", "ENDED"
- Routes events to appropriate subsystem
- Composites surfaces to display

### 3. Switching Logic ✅
- **Knight Death**: Automatically detected → pauses Arena → switches to LC mode
- **Problem Solved**: Detects correct submission → ends game → shows victory overlay
- **Timer Expiry**: 30-second countdown → revives Knight → returns to Arena mode

### 4. Display Composition ✅
- Controller's `draw()` method blits active surface to display
- No display.flip() calls in Arena when rendering to surface
- Clean surface switching without artifacts

### 5. Separation of Concerns ✅
- Arena.py: Minimal changes (only added screen parameter)
- Controller manages both subsystems independently
- Each subsystem owns its rendering surface
- Clean state transition management

## Technical Details

### Files Created
- `controller.py` (148 lines) - Main game controller
- `lc_screen.py` (136 lines) - LeetCode UI wrapper
- `test_controller.py` (126 lines) - Integration tests
- `test_game_flow.py` (109 lines) - Game flow tests
- `capture_screenshots.py` - Screenshot generator
- Documentation: RUNNING.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md

### Files Modified
- `arena.py` - Added screen parameter, removed display.flip() when using surface
- `main.py` - Updated to use GameController
- `README.md` - Added usage instructions and screenshots

### Code Changes Summary
- **Lines Added**: ~600 (new files)
- **Lines Modified in Arena**: ~15 (minimal surgical changes)
- **Tests Added**: 2 comprehensive test suites
- **Test Coverage**: All state transitions and game flows

## Game Flow

```
START → ARENA MODE
         ↓ (Knight dies)
         LC MODE (30s timer)
         ├─ (Timer expires) → ARENA MODE (Knight revived)
         └─ (Problem solved) → ENDED (Victory!)
                                 ↓ (Press R)
                               ARENA MODE (Restart)
```

## Testing

### Integration Tests (test_controller.py)
```
✓ Initialization test
✓ Knight death detection  
✓ LC timer functionality
✓ State transition flow
✓ Surface rendering
```

### Game Flow Tests (test_game_flow.py)
```
✓ Complete game cycle simulation
✓ Timer expiry scenario
✓ Problem solved scenario
✓ Input handling in all states
```

All tests passing: **100%**

## Screenshots

Visual verification of all game states:
- Arena Mode: Fighting game with health bars
- LeetCode Mode: Problem UI with timer countdown
- Victory State: Success overlay

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Arena can still run standalone: `python3 arena.py`
✅ No breaking changes to existing Arena functionality
✅ Controller is additive, not replacing existing code

## How to Use

```bash
# Run the integrated game
python3 main.py

# Or directly
python3 controller.py

# Run standalone arena (still works)
python3 arena.py

# Run tests
python3 test_controller.py
python3 test_game_flow.py
```

## Design Principles Followed

1. **Minimal Changes**: Only modified what was necessary in arena.py
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has clear responsibility
3. **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage for all transitions
4. **Documentation**: Clear documentation for users and developers
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code still works

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

- Surface blending for smooth transitions
- Multiple LeetCode problems in sequence
- Health recovery on problem solve
- Difficulty scaling
